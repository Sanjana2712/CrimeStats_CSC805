The project aims at creating a set of visualizations to analyze the crime statistics of the United States over the last 20 years. To a basic user, looking at data directly and deducing the required information can be difficult. Our visualizations aim at providing information that might be useful to the user in a manner that is intuitive. The visualizations are aided with filters and toggles to help user prioritize the aspects of information that is required.

END GOALS -
 A geographical representation of crimes across The USA for a graphical way for user to interact.
 A comparison between various types of crimes and their rates in a year for users to track development of different crimes.
 A tool for users to compare crime variations in different states over the years according to specifications the user needs.
 Transition of crime rate for different crime categories over years for a time-based presentation.
 An absolute comparison between overall crime in various states filtered by the year.
